- [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) is a Kafka compatible, Zookeeper-free, JVM-free and source available streaming data platform. It is used as Kafka replacement on local computer to replace Kafka assuming corresponding Kafka client is compatible.
	- Hypothesis: it can be used 100% alongside Spring Cloud Stream with Kafka binder
	- It's also used with 100% compatibility with [franz-go](https://github.com/twmb/franz-go)
	- It will be personal choice if I need to run it on VM by myself due to low maintenance (Zookeeper-free and single binary) and support tiered storage
