- Performance review
	- Don't focus on ratings. Focus on feedback so that it become the guideline for improvement in the future -> ratings are skewed because multiple factors for reviewer (i.e. they are hurry to complete it, give not detailed feedback, etc)
		- If you're not appraised appropriately, feedback are still the most treasured thing. Because, you can understand your future improvement area, and it can become the lighthouse for your future endeavor (not always in the company)
		- Focus on opportunity and improvement area
	- Don't worry if got "average" -> it basically said that you meet the expectation
		- Someone had different priority. Someone can focus to maximize their career growth. Someone may prefer to prioritize their family over works -> hence maximize just to meet the expectation
		- TODO -> provide a link from HN where someone said it -> I remember it's from `Dirty Works`
	- How to solve issue about recency bias?
		- Produce an event registar to capture feedbacks between the person and their manager . It become source of truth to record key takeaways for their journey between particular timeline. That's why regular 1:1 records are essentials
		- Tips: You can try to search on the artifacts to recall when we give feedback (GitHub / JIRA / Confluence)
	- Good resources to provide the frameworks for performance review
		- https://github.com/jorgef/engineeringladders - a framework for engineering managers
		- TODO -> provide books for both engineering / staff ladder
